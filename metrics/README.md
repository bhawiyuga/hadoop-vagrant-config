metrics-watch
================================

# Introduction

By combining Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (ELK) to create an end-to-end stack for metrics collection, storing, indexing and viewing.

We have been collecting metrics from YARN (running_apps + pending_apps) and openlava cluster (running_jobs + pending_jobs). More metrics can be added easily through providing: i) a script to collect metrics and dump to a file; and ii) a logstash filter to parse the metrics. All these metrics collection aims at helping on auto-scaling among multi-tenant clusters.

## Metrics-watch environment is setup as follows:

1. node2: logstash + elasticsearch + kibana
2. node2 - node5: metrics collector

## How metrics-watch works

1. Metrics collector collects metrics data periodically and persists to files on HDFS/NFS/S3, etc. Collector on resource manager (node2) reports the metrics from YARN. Collector on openlava master host reports the metrics from openlava cluster.
2. Logstash creates a pipeline for receiving metrics data from files, processing and outputting structured data into Elasticsearch.
3. Kibana is metrics visualization engine, allowing viewing Elasticsearch's metrics via custom dashboards.

# Getting Started

SSH into node2 and run the following command to start metrics-watch.

## Start Elasticsearch

```
/usr/local/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch & >/dev/null 2>&1
```

## Start metrics collector

```
/vagrant/metrics/bin/startAll.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
```

Metrics are reported every 1 minutes, and data are persisted under folder /vagrant/metrics/data.

If you want to stop metrics collector, run following command.

```
/vagrant/metrics/bin/stopAll.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
```

## Start Logstash for storing metrics with Elasticsearch

```
/usr/local/logstash/bin/logstash -f /usr/local/metrics/logstash-conf/logstash-elasticsearch.conf & >/dev/null 2>&1
```

## Query metrics from Elasticsearch

Run following command to list all the indexes.

```
curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'
```

The Logstash created index is named like "logstash-$date" (e.g., logstash-2015.02.13). Under this index, an example search is querying all metrics related to openlava clusters.

```
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/logstash-2015.02.13/_search?pretty' -d '
{
  "query": { "match": { "application_type": "openlava" } }
}'
```

Refer to http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html for more search APIs. We support following search filed currently. More fields can be added via adding to logstash filter.

```
timestamp
host = "logstash installed host"
type = [yarn, app]
running         #yarn
pending         #yarn
application_id  #openlava
running_jobs    #openlava
pending_jobs    #openlava
```
